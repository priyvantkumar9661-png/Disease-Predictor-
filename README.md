# Disease-Predictor-
# 🧠 AI Disease Predictor Bootcamp Project

Welcome to the **AI Disease Predictor**, a machine learning-based project developed during a bootcamp to showcase how AI can assist in predicting diseases based on user-reported symptoms. This notebook walks through the full pipeline—from data preprocessing to model deployment—making it a great learning resource for beginners and aspiring data scientists.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a predictive model that can identify potential diseases based on a set of symptoms using supervised learning techniques. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can support healthcare diagnostics and decision-making.

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source:** A curated dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases.
- **Format:** CSV file (`heart_dataset.csv`)
- **Features:** Multiple symptom indicators
- **Target:** Disease label

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Model training and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Google Colab**: Development environment

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize symptom distributions
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Model Building**
   - Train models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall

4. **Prediction Interface**
   - Accept user input for symptoms
   - Output predicted disease

## 📈 Results

- Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest Classifier
- Demonstrated reliable predictions across multiple symptom combinations
